<h1>Active Directory Deployed in the Cloud (Azure)</h1>
This tutorial outlines the implementation of on-premises Active Directory within Azure Virtual Machines.<br />



<h2>Environments and Technologies Used</h2>

- Microsoft Azure (Virtual Machines/Compute)
- Remote Desktop
- Active Directory Domain Services
- PowerShell

<h2>Operating Systems Used </h2>

- Windows Server 2022
- Windows 10 (21H2)

<h2>High-Level Deployment and Configuration Steps</h2>

- Step 1: Create Resources in Azure - Domain Controller VM and Client VM 
- Step 2: Ensure Connectivity between the Client and Domain Controller
- Step 3: Install Active Directory (AD)
- Step 4: Create an Admin and Normal User Account in AD
- Step 5: Join the Client VM to the Domain Controller VM
- Step 6: Setup Remote Desktop for non-administrative users on the Client VM
- Step 7: Create additional users and log in to the Client VM with one of the users

<h2>Deployment and Configuration Steps</h2><br>

<h3>Step 1: Create Resources in Azure - Domain Controller VM and Client VM</h3><br>
<p>

</p>
<p>
In this lab, we will create two VMs in the same VNET. One will be a Domain Controller (DC-1), and the other will be a Client VM (Client-1). We will set the Domain Controller's NIC Private IP Address to static because it is providing Active Directory services to the Client VM. 
</p>
<br />

<h3>Step 2: Ensure Connectivity between the Client and Domain Controller</h3><br>

</p>

<p>
To ensure connectivity between the two VMs, first log in to DC-1 and enable ICMPv4 on the local windows firewall. Then ping DC-1's private IP address from Client-1 and assess that the ping is successful.
</p>
<br />

<h3>Step 3: Install Active Directory (AD)</h3><br>
<p>
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/TvX0sSb.png" height="80%" width="80%" alt="Disk Sanitization Steps"/>
</p>
<p>
On DC-1 install Active Directory Domain Services and promote it to a domain controller by setting up a new forest and naming it "mydomain.com." Then restart the DC-1 VM and log in as "mydomain.com\trust" (note that "trust" can be substituted with any username assigned to DC-1).
</p>
<br />

<h3>Step 4: Create an Admin and Normal User Account in AD</h3><br>
<p>
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/QHdvVq3.png" height="80%" width="80%" alt="Disk Sanitization Steps"/>
</p>
<p>
To create Admin and Normal User accounts within Active Directory, open Active Directory Users and Computers (ADUC) from the Windows Start menu . Within ADUC, create Organizational Units (OU), also known as user accounts. The OU for Admins will be named "_ADMINS;" the OU for Normal Users will be named "_EMPLOYEES." To create the OU for Normal Users, right click on mydomain.com, click new, click "Organizational Unit," and name it "_EMPLOYEES." To create the OU for Admins, right click on mydomain.com, click new, click "Organizational Unit," and name it "_ADMINS." Then create a new employee, named "Jane Doe," and assign her the username, "jane_admin." Jane is an Admin, so we will add her to the "Domain Admins" Security Group. Henceforth, we will use jane_admin as the admin account.
</p>
<br />

<h3>Step 5: Join the Client VM to the Domain Controller VM</h3><br>
<p>
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/M75vue2.png" height="80%" width="80%" alt="Disk Sanitization Steps"/>
</p>
<p>
From the Azure Portal, change Client-1's DNS settings to DC-1's Private IP address. Once this is done, restart Client-1 from within the Azure portal. The picture shows verification that Client-1 is using DC-1's DNS. Next, log in to Client-1 VM as the original local admin, using the username mydomain.com\please (note that "please" can be substituted with any user name assigned to Client-1). Next, right click on the Windows Start icon, navigate to Systems, click "Rename this PC (advanced)," click "Change," click "Domain" and name it "mydomain.com." Enter the credentials for jane_admin.  The computer will restart and Client-1 will now be a part of mydomain.com. 
</p>
<br />

<h3>Step 6: Setup Remote Desktop for non-administrative users on the Client VM</h3><br>
<p>
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/KtDr8a0.png" height="80%" width="80%" alt="Disk Sanitization Steps"/>
</p>
<p>
Log in to Client-1 as an admin (we will use mydomain.com\jane_admin). Open system properties. Click "Remote Desktop," and allow "domain users" access to remote desktop. We will now be able to log in to Client-1 as a normal, non-administrative user (this would normally be done with Group Policy, which allows you to change many systems at once).
</p>
<br />

<h3>Step 7: Create additional users and log in to the Client VM with one of the users</h3><br>

</p><br>

<p>
Last, to verify that normal users can log in to Client-1, we will use a script to generate thousands of users. Next, log in to DC-1 as jane_admin. Open PowerShell_ISE as an administrator and input the script. Select one of the users from the script and log in to Client-1, as a normal user, using his credentials.
